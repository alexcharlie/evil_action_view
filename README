A plugin expressly made for the purposes of being evil with view rendering.

Makes it easy to render views for when you do things on facebook API like sending notifications in an after_save.

class User < ActiveRecord::Base

  include EvilActionView
  after_save :notify_user

  def notify_user
    send_notification(evil.render :partial => "user_notification", :locals => self.attributes)
  end
end


Also, I added a janky part controller thing.  It works, but its not very good right now
